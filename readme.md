# ChainLib is an open-source digital library on blockchain

#### ChainLib - a digital NFT library, an open NFT marketplace created for authors providing a "shelf space" and visibility to their readers, with copyright protection ensured by blockchain technology.

## Features

1. User Module and Copyright registration (authors' works uploaded as NFT on Chainlib). The copyright owner registers
   the copyright of the digital works on the system as NFTs. During the registration process, the fingerprint
   information of the digital works is extracted and stored on the blockchain.


2. Copyright transfer: after the copyright receiver purchases the copyright and pays the corresponding consideration,
   the copyright owner calls the smart contract to transfer the copyright to the copyright receiver.

## Future features

We aim to expand the traditional functionality of NFT, by implementing generative art into books as NFTs generation
methodology. Our project introduces a new concept - personalized books minted programmatically as NFT based on
predefined NFT owner’s parameters. Generative art in itself is a fundamental medium that challenges our concept of art
creation and value, offering endless possibilities of automated artworks with every run of the program. Now imagine what
new horizons can be touched by bringing generative art into the book industry.

## Philosophy

Our project emerges on the digital library market as a solution meant to kill the biggest authors' problems: copyright
protection and direct access to their readers without intermediaries. We want to enhance new information exchange
methods between authors’ and readers. We expect a great popularity among authors and, especially readers, as we seek to
implement borderless opportunities of NFT and generative art. Programmable books can be a new page in a digital
library’s history. A lot of users should embrace this new books generating methodology.

## What's cool about this?

We aim to extend NFT marketplace functionality by implementing :

* Personalized story tales as NFTs - programmable story tales as NFTs with predefined reader’s parameters. I.E. story
  tales for children. Parents can order books with their child right inside the story. All they need is add their
  child’s name, sex, age, even image and our platform will mint a personalized NFT containing the story tale with their
  child inside it. It remains only to order a printed copy of the book with created personalized NFT
* Generative NFT books are powered by a non-human system to generate new content programmatically, constantly
  manipulating the variable possibilities. Imagine that You bought an NFT containing a story tale with Your child inside
  it. Now imagine that this NFT is programmed to generate from-time-to-time new story tales with Your child inside it,
  with the same predefined reader’s parameters. A new story could be unlocked any time for NFT owners. All they have to
  do is periodically check their NFT status on our platform
